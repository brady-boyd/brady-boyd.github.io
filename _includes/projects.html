    <h3> Litter Getter </h3>
    <p>Since graduating June 16, 2023, most of the time I have spent coding has been work on Litter Getter. Litter Getter is an Android application written in Java that allows users to mark and discover litter hotspots. Litter Getter utilizes an AWS DynamoDB to store the litter location information and Firebase for user authentication/management.</p>
    <p>Litter Getter was published on the Google Play Store on July 10, 2023.</p>
